# CollabBing
It's hip, it's cool, it's CollabBing!

This is a (very) simple public domain clone of a website called [Mystery Search](https://mysterysear.ch) that was the 2017 April Fools prank for Computernewb. What's done here is definitely not the best way to do it, but if you want a VERY basic clone that you can set up in a few seconds, then this is for you.

If you don't know what Mystery Search is, you basically type in a query into the textbox and you will get the last person's search, and the person after you will get your query, and so on. 

# Using another search engine 
I designed this for use with Bing, because Bing is the best search engine ever created. Joking aside, it is extremely easy to configure this to use another search engine. 

Open the index.php. On Line 4, there will be something that looks like this.

``` 'Location: http://www.bing.com/search?q='```

Change this to the search engine of your choice. Some examples:

* Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=
* DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=
* Yahoo: https://search.yahoo.com/search?q=
